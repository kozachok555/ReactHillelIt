              I strive for stability in both work and life. It is important for
              me to have confidence in the future, the ability to plan ahead,
              and opportunities for growth. I want to do what I
              love—programming—and work in a great company with good people. I
              also dream of having a family where there is comfort and support.
              Feeling comfortable in an environment where hard work and
              responsibility are valued is essential for me.

              I find it difficult to tolerate other people's mistakes, but I am
              aware of this and try to work on myself. I feel comfortable
              working in a team, but if someone is unwilling to do their part, I
              struggle to motivate them. Sometimes, I lack patience, but I
              understand that compromise is essential in both life and work.
              Stability, trust, and the right environment are what truly matter
              to me.
